# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

## Introduction
The "COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization" project is a comprehensive Spark application designed to provide deep insights into the vast datasets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. With an interactive Command Line Interface (CLI), users can seamlessly query and analyze the data, uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations that shed light on the global impact of the virus.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to offer a tool that facilitates a deeper understanding of COVID-19 data. By identifying trends and patterns, we aim to provide a clearer picture of the pandemic's progression and its multifaceted impacts. Our team has crafted 10 analytical queries to delve into various aspects of the data, aiming to uncover meaningful insights.

## Features
- **Agile Scrum**: Implemented the Agile Scrum methodology for project work. We had a Scrum Master who served as the team lead, conducted daily scrum meetings, and reported any blockers or tasks completed at the end of each day.
- **Interactive CLI**: A user-friendly interface to query and analyze COVID-19 data.
- **User/Admin System**: A robust user and admin system integrated within the Scala console, ensuring data security and facilitating CRUD operations. Passwords are securely encrypted using bCrypt.
- **Visualization**: Leveraging tools like Zeppelin (or Tableau), the project visualizes the analyzed data, making it easier to interpret and understand.
- **Analytical Queries**: Our team developed 10 specific analytical queries to dive deep into the data. These queries can be found [here](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/tree/main/src/main/scala/query). Some of the queries include:
## Analytical Queries
Our team developed 10 specific analytical queries to dive deep into the data. These queries aim to uncover meaningful insights into various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. You can explore each query in detail using the links below:

  - [Percentage Of Population Confirmed](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/blob/main/src/main/scala/query/Q1_PercentageOfPopConfirmed.scala)
  - [Average Confirmed, Death, and Recovery Rates](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/blob/main/src/main/scala/query/Q2_AvgConfrimedDeathRecov.scala)
  - [Peak of Deaths](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/blob/main/src/main/scala/query/Q3_PeakOfDeaths.scala)
  - [Highest Death By Country](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/blob/main/src/main/scala/query/Q4_HighestDeathByCountry.scala)
  - [General Disease Evolution](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/blob/main/src/main/scala/query/Q5_GeneralDiseaseEvolution.scala)
  - [Average Recovery Rate](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/blob/main/src/main/scala/query/Q6_AvgRecoveredRate.scala)
  - [Confirmed Cases By Day](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/blob/main/src/main/scala/query/Q7_ConfirmedByDay.scala)
  - [Total Confirmed, Deaths, and Recoveries](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/blob/main/src/main/scala/query/Q8_Total_CDR.scala)
  - [Confirmed Spread Speed](https://github.com/NewyorkMengHer/COVID-19-Data-Visualization/blob/main/src/main/scala/query/Q9_ConSpreadSpeed.scala)

Each query provides a unique perspective on the data, offering insights that can aid in understanding the pandemic's progression and impact.


## Challenges
- **Data Cleaning**: One of the significant challenges faced was cleaning the extensive dataset, which comprised over 200,000 rows. Ensuring accuracy and relevance was paramount to the project's success.

## Technologies Used
- Apache Spark
- Spark SQL
- YARN
- HDFS 
- Scala 2.12.10
- Git + GitHub
- Zeppelin (or Tableau)

## Conclusion
This project serves as a testament to the power of data analysis and visualization in understanding complex scenarios like a global pandemic. Whether you're a researcher, data analyst, or someone keen on understanding the nuances of COVID-19, this tool provides a comprehensive platform for exploration and discovery.
